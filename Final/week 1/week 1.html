            <u>We started off this semester with a kahoot quiz and understanding and comparing CUI and GUI.</u>
            <p>I wanted to focus on the differences that would have the most effect on my choice of what to use. Iâ€™ll talk about the operating mode, performance, learning curve and room for error. The GUI works through visual aspects such as icons, boxes and windows. While the CLI is more based on user commands and inputs. However, the CLI is more efficient and quicker. Performance is reduced for the GUI because more system resources are used. For me, this is the most important part to know about, the learning curve. CLI is definitely more advanced because you need to learn and memorize commands, sometimes with the commands being complex. While the GUI provides the user with more options and choices with the visual aspects, it is easier to learn from overall. CLI is also more unforgiving as misspelled commands can cause errors or even delete files. GUI asks the user to confirm their actions. I would think the GUI is best for starters, easy to learn the ropes and get some practice in, while the CLI is for those who are confident in their skills and knowledge! </p>
